Data parser - A Personal pet project of mine to help me learn c++,
It is a class libary that parses data formats from files.
Currently supports
- Endianness
- read and write
- data types -- byte, short, long, float, double and arrays
Looking to add support for bitfields, opengl quaternion and opengl vectors.
I will accept any suggestions, questions or criticism 
- either email, through issue submissions, or otherwise.
